# Edge Agent

## What is the Edge Agent?

The Edge Agent is a lightweight service that can process access check requests. It can be deployed in any cloud environment to minimize the latency of access check requests from services using WorkOS FGA to enforce authorization. The Edge Agent serves access check requests from a local cache and keeps caches up-to-date from the cloud service.

## Should I use the Edge Agent?

Teams with strict latency and reliability requirements can deploy the Edge Agent in their own infrastructure for improved latency and availability.
